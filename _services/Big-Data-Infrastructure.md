## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

### Verifiability
Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.

### Comparability
Comparability is the uniform application of methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application across points in time within an entity.

### Understandability
Understandability means that reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.
